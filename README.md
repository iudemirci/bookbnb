# Bookbnb

**Bookbnb** is a full-stack vacation rental application inspired by **Airbnb**, built using **React**, **Ant Design Framework** and **Supabase**. It includes an **admin panel** and **dashboard** for managing listings, users, reports, and application analytics. The app allows users to list properties, make reservations, and explore accommodations with dynamic filters. This project served as an advanced playground for developing and integrating complex features like **multi-step forms**, **wishlist functionality**, **reporting**, **multilanguage & multicurrency support**, and more ‚Äî all wrapped in a clean, responsive UI.
